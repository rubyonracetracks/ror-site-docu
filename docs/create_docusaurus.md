Docusaurus is an excellent Javascript framework for a static site that consists primarily of documentation or a tutorial.  You can use the [Docusaurus Neutrino](https://gitlab.com/rubyonracetracks/docusaurus_neutrino.git) tool to create a new Docusaurus app.  When you use Docusaurus Neutrino, the app you create not only builds correctly from the get go but also comes with Bash scripts for many routine tasks.  In other words, it applies the Rails Neutrino idea to Docusaurus.
