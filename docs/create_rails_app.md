Ruby on Racetracks has two tools for creating a new, high-quality Rails app.
1. The [Generic App gem](https://www.genericapp.net/) takes just seconds to give you a new high-quality Rails app with fairly up-to-date gems in the Gemfile.  Generic App uses a prebuilt Rails app as the basis for your new Rails app.
2.  The [Rails Neutrino tool](https://www.railsneutrino.com/) takes just minutes to give you a new high-quality Rails app with fully up-to-date gems in the Gemfile.  I use Rails Neutrino to build boilerplate Rails apps to be used by Generic App.
